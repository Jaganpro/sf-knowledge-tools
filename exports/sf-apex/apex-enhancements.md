### Release Notes for Features Released Monthly

Release Notes for Features Released Monthly 
For some products, Salesforce releases features and enhancements more frequently than three times 
per year. 
Release Note Changes 
Read about what changes were made after the release notes were published. Changes are separated 
by product and with the most recent changes first. The dates indicate the week that changes to the 
release note were made. Review the individual release note availability details. 
How and When Do Features Become Available? 
Some features affect all users immediately after the release goes live. Consider communicating these 
changes to your users beforehand so that they’re prepared. Other features require direct action by an 
administrator before users can benefit from the new functionality. 
Salesforce Overall

### Release Updates

Release Updates

for your organization to enable. Some release updates affect existing customizations.

and packages for resale to other organizations.

data across your enterprise. Streamline operations by building and automating processes with clicks 
instead of code. You can design, develop, govern, and share APIs and integration apps and host them 
in the cloud or on-premises. 
Mobile 
The Salesforce mobile app now uses single sign-on for faster logins and notifications that lets you work 
on tasks. Create mobile and offline ready Lightning Web components with Mobile MCP tools. 
Omnistudio 
Validate your workflows built with Omniscripts and Flexcards end-to-end by using the UI Test 
Automation Model (UTAM) framework. For a fast, scalable experience, add Omnscripts and Flexcards 
to Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) Experience Cloud sites (pilot). Get immediate help with an 
Omnistudio component or element with the Omnistudio Assistance AI Agent (pilot). With accessibility 
improvements for Omniscripts and Flexcards, create inclusive workflows and solutions for customers
